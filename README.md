Testify
=======

Source code for UW students to upload/download previous exams. (In development)

Web App: Website (HTML/JS) and back end stuff (Java/Python).

I think it would be a pretty cool idea that we had a website that had all the courses and we/others could upload previous tests and easily have it accessible for people to view.
